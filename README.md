# üéµ Spotify Listening Time & ‚ôüÔ∏è Chess Game Performance Analysis

## üìñ Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between **Spotify listening time** and **chess game performance**. It aims to uncover patterns or correlations that may exist between music consumption and cognitive abilities. The analysis focuses on the following scenarios:
- Variations in chess performance at different times of day (e.g., morning vs. evening games).
- Effects of listening habits (e.g., total listening time, genres) on high-stakes vs. casual games.
- Impact of specific playlists or music genres on strategic thinking.

By examining this data, the project seeks to provide insights into the influence of music on mental performance during chess games.

## üìä Dataset
This project combines two primary datasets:
1. **Spotify Listening Data**:
   - Total listening time (minutes) per day or session.
   - Music genres, playlists, or artists.
   - Start and end times for listening sessions.

2. **Chess Game Performance Data**:
   - Game outcomes (win, loss, draw).
   - Chess ratings over time.
   - Move duration and total game time.
   - Opponent rating and difficulty level.

### Key Features:
- Time alignment between Spotify sessions and chess games.
- Aggregated daily data for listening time and game performance metrics.

## üîê Data Privacy
All data used in this project is collected from personal accounts and remains **anonymized**. This project is conducted strictly for academic purposes and adheres to ethical data usage guidelines.

---

## üí° Project Idea
This project aims to:
- Analyze the correlation between **Spotify listening habits** and **chess performance**.
- Investigate how **music trends** (e.g., genres, duration) align with better or worse chess outcomes.
- Explore whether music enhances focus and cognitive performance during chess games.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Plan

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection:
- **Spotify Data**: Export listening history via the Spotify API and preprocess for total listening time, genres, and playlists.
- **Chess Data**: Retrieve game history via platforms like Chess.com or Lichess APIs, including outcomes, move times, and ratings.
- **Integration**: Align timestamps to correlate Spotify sessions with chess games.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Analysis:
- **Spotify Listening Trends**:
  - Calculate daily listening time and session-based data.
  - Explore genre and playlist preferences during strong vs. weak chess performances.
- **Chess Game Performance**:
  - Assess metrics such as win/loss ratio, rating changes, and move duration.
- **Correlation**:
  - Determine relationships between listening habits and chess outcomes.
  - Analyze whether specific genres or playlists impact performance.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization:
- **Time-Series Plots**: Display listening time and chess performance trends over time.
- **Scatterplots & Heatmaps**: Show correlations between listening habits and game outcomes.
- **Bar Charts**: Compare chess performance across different music genres or playlists.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Reporting:
- Summarize key findings and insights.
- Discuss possible reasons behind observed patterns and suggest actionable takeaways.
- Explore how music might enhance strategic thinking or cognitive focus.
